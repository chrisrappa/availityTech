Currently if the registration was succesfull you'll see a console.log alerting that it was.
The routes are mostly set up so that you can push user registration to the database and the
scafollding is ready to handle users logging in. 

Will continue to build out alerts and redirects for successful user logins/registrations. I have completed
this feature in my repo that you can find here from a former project: https://github.com/chrisrappa/onlinestore/blob/main/frontend/src/Screens/RegisterScreen.js
